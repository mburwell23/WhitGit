# this file looks at everything about the users

# username and email have to be unique to the users
# but gitlab does not check if the email address is real
# it checks if the user entered email has the format of an email address
# so we can check the users based on their username, which will be their whitworth username

# WHEN I LOOKED AT THE USER LIST FROM TERMINAL, I SAW A USER WITH THE USERNAME: 'ghost'
# THIS USER COULD NOT BE PERMANENTLY DELETED. EVERYTIME I DELETED IT, THE USER WAS STILL IN THE USER LIST
# THE PROGRAM NEVER GAVE ME ANY ERRORS WHEN I TRIED TO DELETE THIS USER
